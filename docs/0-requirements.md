# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

DMs (Dungeon Masters) have trouble keeping track of their endless enemy statblocks while playing their campaigns, this website will make that easier by having them all in one place, and allowing DMs to filter for what they're looking for.


## End-User Requirements

DMs would need a simplistic design with clear indications of what their actions will do, and they'll need a way to filter any enemy statblocks that they add to their list of statblocks.

## Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.
